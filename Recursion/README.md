# Recursion
Recursive Function : Function which is calling itself, then it is termed as a recursive function. There must be some base condition that will terminate recursion.

returnType function (parameters) {
    ...
    if (baseCondition) {
        ...  -> Ascendig Phase
        function();
        ...  -> Descending Phase
    }
}
Recursive functions are traced in form of a tree.
Recursive Functions are like rubber-bands, if we strech a rubber band, on releasing, it will come back.
# Stack is utilised in Recursion.

T(n) = 1           if n=0
       T(n-1)+1    if n>0

# Time Complexity?

T(n) = T(n-1) + 1
     = T(n-2) + 1 + 1
     = T(n-3) + 1 + 1 + 1
     = T(n-k) + k
                            Assuming n-k = 0
                                     k = n
     = T(n-n) + n
     = T(0) + n
     = 1 + n

So, the time complexity will be O(n).

# Static Variables in Recursion
Static variables are allocated memory for once only so the same value is achieved after the calling is complete.

# Global Variables in Recursion
Global variables and Static Variables behave similarly in Recursion.
